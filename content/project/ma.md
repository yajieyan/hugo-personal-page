This project presents a robust medial axis generation pipeline. It consists of two works:

+ Voxel Core: Efficient, robust, and provably good approximation of 3D medial axes. [See readme]({{<ref "project/voxelcore-readme.md">}})
+ Erosion thickness on medial axes of 3D shapes

(details coming soon...)
